GUI Wifi Password Extractor can be used to extract the WiFi passwords which are already saved in your windows machine. It works by automating the process of running "netsh wlan show profile={profile} key=clear" in the cmd or Command Prompt. This is especially focussed towards those non tech savvy folks who dont have to go to their command prompts to get the passwords anymore! Try it out, its fun seeing those passwords ;)
